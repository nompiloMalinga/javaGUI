# javaGUI
In this project I use input dialog box(showInputDialog) to prompt the user to input length and width of a rectangle. And then I make use of the output dialog box(showMessageDialog) to display the area and perimeter of the rectangle. The methods I used are contained in the JOptionPane class and this class is contained in the javax.swing package.
